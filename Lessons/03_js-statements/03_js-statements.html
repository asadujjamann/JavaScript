        <li class="list-group-item"> In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> JavaScript statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> On the web, you might see examples without semicolons. Ending statements with semicolon is not </li>required, but highly recommended.
        <li class="list-group-item"> JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters. If a JavaScript  statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}. The purpose of  code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> JavaScript Reserved Keywords: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp</a> </li>
